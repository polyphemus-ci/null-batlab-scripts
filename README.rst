========================

This repository contains a set of scripts to simulate a `BaTLab <batlab.org>`_ run while doing no actual work on this system.  These scripts exist primarily as a means of testing `Polyphemus <https://github.com/polyphemus-ci/polyphemus>`_ . There are scripts to simulate both passing and failing BaTLab runs.
